# Kafka-CDC-Pipeline
In this project, I enabled CDC in MSSQL and built a pipeline using Debezium to stream database changes into Kafka. Using Docker Compose, I deployed Zookeeper, Kafka, Kafka Connect (Debezium), and Kafka UI containers, and successfully captured real-time events from the dbo.Customers table.
